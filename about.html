              Rahat is an aspiring full stack developer from Bronx, NY. His foray into web development started in his music carrer when he was tasked with creating his own website. He found it very challenging and decided he needed to learn how to code.
              He joined the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp in order to develop the skills necassary to not only create his own website but also to become an insanely awesome web developer.

              Rahat does not enjoy long walks on the beach, but instead loves writing, creating music, eating food, and playing video games. His favorite game of all time is the RPG classic, Chrono Trigger. He still hopes that a true sequal to Chrono
              Trigger will one day be released. His favorite food is steak and his least favorite beach is Orchard beach.

              Rahat recently married and is paying mortgage on a house. He is, as they say, "adulting".
